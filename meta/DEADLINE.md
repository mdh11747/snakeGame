## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

> I chose to make a game. My game is a personal recreation of the classic
> game Snake, which is a game in which the player uses the arrow keys in
> order to manipulate the snake to eat as many apples as possible. As the
> snake eats each apple, its length grows by one tile. The goal is to avoid
> the snake from running into its own tail or the border whilst growing it
> to an increasingly longer length by eating apples.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

> I learned how to code games in JavaFX, which is something somewhat simple
> that I have always wanted to do but lacked the knowledge. It's just cool
> to be able to experience the fruits of my labor in a fun way rather than
> the technical ways that we have been taught.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

> I think I may have implemented the backgrounds and images in a different
> way because drawing the grid background was inefficient and it makes it
> to where the dimensions of the game cannot be changed. Therefore,
> rewriting this part with rectangles or something would make it easier
> to modify the code and perhaps add game modes.
